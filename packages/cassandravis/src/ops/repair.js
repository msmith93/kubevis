// The `repair` (anti-entropy) op: replicas compare Merkle trees of their data
// per key range and stream only the divergent entries; newest timestamp wins.
// This catches divergence that hints and read repair missed. Payload, built by
// App from the folded cluster:
//   { id,
//     comparisons: [{ key, token, replicas, entries: {node: entry|null}, match }],
//     diffs: [{ key, winner, from, targets: [node], color }] }
// comparisons cover every key, restricted to UP replicas; diffs are the keys
// where an up replica is stale/missing (winner = newest entry, from = a node
// that holds it).
